# Unity-OneButtonMechanics
A collection of minigames, but really a collection of useful components for students completing the one-button project prompt

## First, explore the various games. Then look at and into all of the components that make them up. I have split up components as much as possible to aid in flexibility. 

To be honest, I wouldn't copy these scripts directly into your projects. Instead, make your own as appropriate, and then use the techniques in the code.

## Complexity
I have minimized complexity where possible. The games here are just mechanics, with no proper game loop/manager system for restarting or such. I avoid using coroutines, avoid c#8 features, and I don't really bother with optimizing code. I have commented where appropritae, but most of the code remains uncommented.

## Events
Where reasonable, I have created UnityEvents that one could use to easily hook up other systems or player feedback, like playing audio and so on.
